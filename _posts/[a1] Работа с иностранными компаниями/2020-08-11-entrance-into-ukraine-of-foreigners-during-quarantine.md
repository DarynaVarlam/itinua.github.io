According to Resolution of Cabinet of Ministry of Ukraine №287-p, starting from 17 of March 2020, in order to avoid epidemy of COVID-19 only foreigners having residency
permit, spouses of citizens of Ukraine and some other special categories of people, could enter Ukraine. Otherwise special approval from Ministry of Foreign Affairs was
required for each special case.
12 of June 2020 the above restrictions were cancelled by Resolution of CMU № 477. New Resolution of CMU №522 published June 25th, 2020 introduces some new requirements 
for those intending to enter the territory of Ukraine. In connection with quarantine which started in Ukraine on the 12th of March 2020, some temporary migration rules have 
been introduced. 

**Insurance covering COVID-19**

Person who is not a citizen of Ukraine and not a refugee, entering Ukraine, should have medical police/certificate covering expenses due to COVID-19 treatment and observation stay.
The insurance certificate can be purchased online directly from the Ukrainian insurance company, a comparative list of which we provide in the table below. In addition,
a foreigner, at their own request, can choose a foreign insurance company that has a representative office in Ukraine, or which has a contractual relationship with any 
Ukrainian insurance company.
In this case, the minimum insurance period should amount to the period of stay of a person in Ukraine. If the deadline is not defined, then 14 days with a mandatory 
subsequent extension until departure must be covered. There are no requirements for the sum of the insurance as such. A person chooses it with on their own will.

**Observation**

A 14-day observation for citizens of the red zone according to the decree of CMU 522 is not necessary in the case of voluntary PCR testing for coronavirus infection. 
Such testing can be done in special medical institutions within 24 hours from the moment of entry into Ukraine or directly at the border control point. Results will 
arrive max up to 3 days from the date of the analysis. At this time, the person should be on temporary short-term self-isolation. If the results are negative, then the
previously mentioned restrictions will be cancelled. The cost of such a test ranges from 50 to 150 $ (1500 - 4000 UAH)

As for now, the algorithm for avoiding 14-day self-isolation for citizens from countries with high incidence of COVID-19 is as follows:
 • Purchase of an insurance policy online (or ordering it through the sites of Ukrainian IC).
 
 • Installation of the application ["Act at home"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ua.gov.diia.quarantine&hl=ru) (for Android users) or 
 ["Act at home"](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%D0%B4%D1%96%D0%B9-%D0%B2%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0/id1504695512)  (for IOS users) after crossing the border. 
 
 • Passing the PCR test.
 
 • The [institution](https://moz.gov.ua/article/health/algoritm-pripinennja-samoizoljacii-dlja-osib-scho-peretnuli-derzhavnij-kordo) where the testing was conducted
 independently sends the results to the Center for Public Health of Ukraine.
 
 • The Ministry of Digital Transformation, based on the data of the Center for Digital Transformation, cancels the mandatory self-isolation in the specified program 
 "Act at home", after which it can be removed. 
 
**Countries with high rate of COVID-19 cases**

The list of countries with high accidents of COVID-19 is regularly published by Ministry of Health. These are the “red zone” states. The latest update was 6 of July,
2020, you can download it [here](https://moz.gov.ua/article/health/informacija-schodo-kilkosti-aktivnih-vipadkiv-covid-19-na-100-tis-naselennja-stanom). The list should
be updated each 3 days.Countries with high accidents of COVID-19 are those having active cases for more than 40 people on 100 000 of population.  The rest (less than 40 
cases per 100 million population) - belong to the green zone. However, at the same time, [there](https://visitukraine.today/ua) is also an official website (created with 
the state support), where the list of countries fromboth the green and red zones is updated daily. 
 
*Exceptions*

At the same time, citizens of the states where COVID-19 is widespread who have not been on the territory of those states for the last 14 days, employees of diplomatic
missions and consular posts of foreign states, officials of official international missions, organizations accredited in Ukraine, and their family members, drivers and 
crew members of freight vehicles, crew members of air and sea, river vessels, members of train and locomotive teams, participants of an external independent evaluation 
together with one person, which accompanies each of them, if there is no reason to believe that they were in contact with a person with COVID-19, are not obliged to undergo 
the observation.
Also, persons who have consented to self-isolation using the “Act at Home” electronic service are not subject to observation. For two weeks, a person will receive up to 
10 daily push notifications in the "Act at home" application. The user will need to take their photo with their geolocation on. If quarantine is violated, which is implied 
by non-use of the application, a person will have to pay a fine.
