For purpose of presenting in Ukraine official documents issued abroad, or official documents of Ukraine to other countries, such as extract from business 
register of companies, power of attorney, these documents are to be legalized in order to have legal validity in Ukraine.

There are 3 ways of legalization of documents.

**a. Apostille**

 Convention (the Apostille Convention).

Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Burundi, Cape Verde, Chile, 
Colombia, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Kingdom of Denmark, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Fiji, 
Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Cyprus, Honduras, Guatemala, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo 
(but Ukraine objected to accession of Kosovo to Convention, so classical legalization between the countries are required), Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lesotho,
