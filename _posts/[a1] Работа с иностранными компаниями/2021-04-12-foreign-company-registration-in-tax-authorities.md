**Registration of a Foreign Company with the Tax Office in Ukraine**

On January 1, 2021, the Law of Ukraine of “On Amendments to the Tax Code of Ukraine and Other Laws of Ukraine on Ensuring the Collection of Data and 
Information Necessary for Declaring Certain Objects of Taxation” dated December 17, 2020 № 1117 (hereinafter - Law № 1117) entered into force.

Law No. 1117, inter alia, amended paragraph 60 of subsection 10 of section XX of the Tax Code of Ukraine (hereinafter - the Code), according to which 
foreign companies with a representative office in Ukraine, registered at the Ministry of Economy shall within three months from 01.01.2021 submit to the 
tax authorities the documents for their registration (as foreign company) in accordance with the procedure established by paragraph 64.5 of Article 64 of 
the Tax Code.

This three-month period was postponed by the Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine # 62 dated 08.02.12021 "On approval of Amendments to the Procedure
for Registration of Payers of Taxes and Fees", which entered into force on 19.03.2021 (hereinafter - Order # 62). 

Under Order # 62, foreign companies are required to register with the tax authority within two months of the entry into force of the Order, i.e. by **19.05.2021**.

For this, a foreign company shall submit to the tax authorities in the city / town where its Representative office in Ukraine is located the following 
documents:
1. Application form 1-OPN (a new one, approved by Order № 62), and a cover letter. 
2. Attached to the application shall be copies of the following documents (with presentation of originals):
- an extract from the relevant national business register (trade, banking or other register, which records the company registration), legalized in the 
prescribed manner, unless otherwise provided by international treaties, the consent binding nature of which is provided by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, 
and accompanied by a notarized translation into Ukrainian;
- a document containing the identification number (registration or accounting code) of the foreign company in the country of its registration, if the 
extract from the relevant business register does not contain information about such a number (code), accompanied by a notarized translation into Ukrainian;
- a document confirming the authorisation of the foreign company’s representative. If such a document is issued in the country of registration of the
 foreign company, it must be legalized in the prescribed manner, unless otherwise provided by international treaties approved by the Verkhovna Rada of 
 Ukraine, and accompanied by a notarized translation into Ukrainian.
In this case the representative shall, along with the power of attorney to submit documents to the tax authority, have the right to represent the interests 
of the foreign company in Ukraine, and the data on such a representative shall be given in the application form in the columns "manager" and "chief 
accountant". A copy of the passport, identification code and/or other document containing the information specified in the application form for the
representative shall be submitted together with the power of attorney.
- a document confirming the accreditation (registration, legalization) of the representative office of a foreign company located in Ukraine 
(the Representative office). 

In the case of establishment of a Representative office, the foreign company shall register itself with the tax authority **within ten days after 
the registration in Ukraine of the Representative company** at its registered address in Ukraine.

At the same time along with the registration of the foreign company shall be the registration of the Representative Office of the foreign company.
The Tax Code also provides for **other grounds for compulsory registration of a foreign company with the Ukrainian tax authority**, namely:
- acquisition of real estate or obtaining property rights to such assets in Ukraine;
- opening a bank account in Ukraine;
- acquisition of title to an investment asset in Ukraine from another foreign company which doesn’t have a representative office in Ukraine.

**Consequences of non-compliance with the legal requirements regarding registration with the tax authorities by a foreign company**
If the tax authority, based on the results of tax control, discovers that a foreign company is conducting business in Ukraine, including through a 
Representative office, without registration of the foreign company in tax authority, the supervisory authority shall appoint an audit for the further 
inspection of such business activities.

Based on the results of an inspection, the tax authority may draw up an act of inspection, and on the basis of which it may unilaterally register the 
foreign company in Ukraine.

In accordance with subparagraph two of paragraph 60 of subsection 10 of section XX of the Tax Code, audits (inspections) of foreign companies engaged in 
business activities in Ukraine, which under requirements of the Tax Code should have been registered with the Tax Office and which have not fulfilled such 
requirements, may be instructed **from 1 July 2021**.

Clause 117.4 of Article 117 of the Tax Code states that a foreign company which carries out its activity through a Representative Office without being 
registered for tax purposes as provided for by Tax Code, shall be fined UAH 100,000.

We admit that the procedure for registering a foreign company in connection with their activities through Representative Office, including a permanent 
establishment, is new and has many nuances, and the supervisory authorities are continuing to clarify them and make amendments that should be taken into 
account when collecting, preparing and submitting documents to the supervisory authority.

related procedures.
